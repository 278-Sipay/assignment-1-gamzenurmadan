The assignment's purpose is to teach the basic use of Fluent Validation Library.
The assignment is done with best practices in mind.
Person Entity class is under the Models folder and Validation Rules for said class is under Validators Folders.
Since the Fluent Validation Library does not have any Phone built-in validator, phone property is only checked with NotEmpty() validator.
Additional error messages are added per validators for better understanding.
